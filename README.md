# Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js
Lucas Sicard

### Summary:
This application keeps track of all of your expenses for any given month! It separates the values into rent, utilities, 
food, & other. Then it adds up all the values & displays everything in an easy-to-read table. You may add new data to 
the table by completing the form on the left, but there is no implementation of modifying or deleting data at this time.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**:
  * I was able to create a single-page app by retrieving the initial data & concatenating it to the end of the table 
  element. This is also represented when the user adds a new entry because it adds to the end of the table.
  The app also modifies the existing "total" row at the bottom of the table.
